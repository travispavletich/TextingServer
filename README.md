# Texting Server

The texting server is a .net core application written in C#.

A finalized release version is not yet available because the application is still in development.
### To run the application:
  - .Net Core version 2.2 must be installed
  - Either Visual Studio (Windows) or Rider (Cross platform) should be installed
  - Clone the repo
  - Open the .sln file in your IDE and hit run

##### The IP Address which the server is running on will spit out in the console. This will be used for the App.
